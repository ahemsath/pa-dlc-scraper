## A scraper/downloader/iTunes library merger for the Penny Arcade Downloadable Content podcast

I orginially wrote this little tool to automate a previously-annoying manual task: when new episodes of "Downloadable Content, The Penny Arcade Podcast" were released, download them and import them into my iTunes library, editing the .mp3 tags to match the naming scheme established back in 2006 ("YYYY-MM-DD Show Title", as opposed to the current season-and-episode-number scheme).

Since this podcast is now available through a normal RSS feed, this tool is no longer required.
